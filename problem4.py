# Largest palindrome product
# Problem 4 
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

999 * 999 # = 998001 so max potential palindrome is 989989
maybe = 989989
