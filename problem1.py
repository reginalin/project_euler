# Multiples of 3 and 5
# Problem 1 
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
# The sum of these multiples is 23.

# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

sum = 0

for num in range(1, 1000):
	if num % 3 == 0:
		sum += num
	elif num % 5 == 0:
		sum += num

print sum

# SOLVE WITHOUT CODE
# First of all, stop thinking on the number 1000 and turn your
#  attention to the number 990 instead. If you solve the problem
#  for 990 you just have to add 993, 995, 996 & 999 to it for
#  the final answer. This sum is (a)=3983

# Count all the #s divisible by 3: From 3... to 990 there are
#  330 terms. The sum is 330(990+3)/2    (b)=163845 
# Count all the #s divisible by 5: From 5... to 990 there are
#  198 terms. The sum is 198(990+5)/2    (c)=98505

# Now, the GCD (greatest common divisor) of 3 & 5 is 1 so the
#  LCM (least common multiple) should be 3x5 15.
# This means every number that divides by 15 was counted twice
#  and it should be done only once. Because of this, you have an
#  extra set of numbers started with 15 all the way to 990 that
#  has to be removed from (b)&(c).
# Then, from 15... to 990 there are 66 terms and the sum is
#  66(990+15)/2    (d)=33165

# The answer for the problem is: (a)+(b)+(c)-(d) = 233168
